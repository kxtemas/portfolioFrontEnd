Growing up in this beautiful state has given me a love for hiking and the opportunity to capture the natural beauty through painting. I come from a close-knit, loving family and am grateful for the relationships I have with them. In March, I am excited to start a new chapter in my life as I tie the knot with my sweet fiancÃ©." +
